 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey </h3></summary>
  I began coding at the age of 14 when I created my first roblox game. It piqued my interest in creating systems by typing them into a computer. I enjoy coding because it helps me understand how things work and expands my imagination. In the summer of 2018, I began learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. For my school project, I built two web applications. These two are fully functional hotel management systems and restaurant delivery systems. I'll create a repository as soon as I find the files. I am currently studying Python and React JS and intend to take the Google certification exam.
