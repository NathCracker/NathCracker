 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey </h3></summary>
   I started coding in the age of 14 by making my very first roblox games. It really piqued my interest on creating systems by typing in the computer. I love coding as it helps me understand how things work and it widens up my imagination. I then started learning HTML, CSS and Javascript the summer of 2018. I created two web applications for my school project. These 2 are fully working hotel management system and restaurant delivery system. I will make a repository soon once i found the files. Im currently studying python and react JS as of right now and plans on taking the google certification exam.
