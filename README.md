<summary><h3>🌱 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>

My programming adventure began at 14 when I created my first Roblox game, sparking my fascination with bringing ideas to life through code. What started as curiosity evolved into a genuine passion for understanding how systems work and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

In summer 2018, I dove into web development, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This foundation led me to create two comprehensive applications: a hotel management system and a restaurant delivery system - both fully functional and solving real-world problems.

Today, I'm expanding my expertise with Python and React.js while preparing for industry certifications. My goal is to bridge my electronics engineering background with software development, creating innovative solutions that impact how we interact with technology.

**Why I code:** It's not just about writing programs - it's about solving problems, expanding possibilities, and building the future one line at a time.
